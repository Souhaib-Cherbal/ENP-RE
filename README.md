![source files/Logo-ENP.png](source files/Logo-ENP.png)

### Overview
**ENP RE** is a Python-based Windows software designed for analyzing and calculating electrical network parameters. It offers tools for generating admittance and impedance matrices, as well as running power flow simulations using Gauss-Seidel, Newton-Raphson, and Fast Decoupled Load Flow (FDLF) methods. This software is aimed at students, engineers, and professionals working with electrical power systems, providing both numerical solutions and easy-to-use interfaces.

### Features
- **Admittance and Impedance Matrix Calculation:**
  - Calculates the Y-bus (admittance) and Z-bus (impedance) matrices for electrical grids.
- **Power Flow Simulation:**
  - Simulates the power flow in the network using:
    - **Gauss-Seidel**
    - **Newton-Raphson**
    - **Fast Decoupled Load Flow (FDLF)**
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
  - Provides an easy-to-navigate interface with visualizations of the input data, matrix generation, and simulation results.
- **Data Input/Output:**
  - Users can input system data for calculations and save the output results.
- **License Key Authentication:**
  - The software requires a license key to run. Example serial code: `3255-6021-8748-1498`.
