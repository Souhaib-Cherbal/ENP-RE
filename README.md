# ENP RE - Electrical Network Parameters Calculation Software

![ENP RE Logo](images/Logo-ENP.png)

## Overview
**ENP RE** is a Windows-based software designed for analyzing and calculating electrical network parameters. It offers tools for generating admittance and impedance matrices, as well as running power flow simulations using Gauss-Seidel, Newton-Raphson, and Fast Decoupled Load Flow (FDLF) methods. This software is aimed at students, engineers, and professionals working with electrical power systems, providing both numerical solutions and an easy-to-use interface.

## Features
- **Admittance and Impedance Matrix Calculation:**
  - Calculates the Y-bus (admittance) and Z-bus (impedance) matrices for electrical grids.
- **Power Flow Simulation:**
  - Simulates the power flow in the network using:
    - Gauss-Seidel
    - Newton-Raphson
    - Fast Decoupled Load Flow (FDLF)
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
  - Provides an easy-to-navigate interface with visualizations of the input data, matrix generation, and simulation results.
- **Data Input/Output:**
  - Users can input system data for calculations and save the output results.
